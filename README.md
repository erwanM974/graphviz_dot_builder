# A simple library for generating dot files to obtain images of directed graphs with subgraphs/clusters

I initially adapted some code for graphviz from [dot-rust](https://github.com/przygienda/dot-rust) in 2020
to be used in some other projects of mine:
[hibou](https://github.com/erwanM974/hibou_label).

Since then it has evolved a bit and I decided to repackage it on its own as a library.
